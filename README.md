# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Egor!  

I'm a **cognitive neuroscientist** and **data scientist** passionate about neuroimaging, signal processing, and data science. My work spans both academia and industry, where I apply advanced data science and AI techniques to solve complex problems in neuroscience and healthcare.

## ðŸ”¬ Current Projects  

- **Naturalistic Neuroimaging Database (version 2)** ðŸ§   
  A large-scale open-access neuroimaging dataset featuring eye-tracking, tonotopy, retinotopy, somatotopy, and cognitive assessments. Open neuroimaging datasets promote scientific transparency, reproducibility, and innovation by enabling researchers worldwide to validate findings, develop new analytical techniques, and apply machine learning models to gain a deeper understanding of the brain. Unlike traditional controlled experiments, naturalistic paradigms provide richer, more ecologically valid insights into cognition and behaviour.

- **Movement Reduction System for Improved MRI Data** ðŸ‘¤  
  Developing and validating a head movement reduction system for MRI experiments. This project involves fMRI preprocessing, statistical modelling, and signal processing to assess the systemâ€™s effectiveness in improving data quality. We compare the quality of fMRI data with and without the system to quantify its impact on motion artefacts and overall signal integrity.

- **Neurometry** ðŸ“Š  
  A data-driven approach to cognitive neuroscience, leveraging machine learning for neuropsychiatric monitoring. At Neurometry, we focus on real-world AI applications in neurotech, including clinical decision support and cognitive well-being analysis.
